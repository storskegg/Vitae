# Vitae
A Basic Life Counter for MTG

## Why
To serve as an example of my work using modern front end technologies, and to
fulfill a personal desire for a decent life counter the few times I sit and
play a game of MTG. While the app itself isn't technically advanced, it will
certainly demonstrate quality in code scaffolding and style.

## What
* Meteor
* React / JSX
* ES6 / Babel
* Foundation / Bootstrap
